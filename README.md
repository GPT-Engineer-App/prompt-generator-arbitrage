    Write a Solidity smart contract that performs arbitrage trading across multiple token pairs between Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2. The contract should:

Explanation
Token Pairs: The token_pairs list contains dictionaries with information about each token pair, including their prices on Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2.
Dynamic Prompt: The generate_prompt function constructs a prompt by inserting the token pair data into a predefined template.
Generated Prompt: The resulting prompt will include all relevant details for the Groq API to generate the appropriate Solidity smart contract.
Example Output
Given the example token_pairs data, the generated prompt will look something like this:

Write a Solidity smart contract that performs arbitrage trading across multiple token pairs between Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2. The contract should:
- Use a flash loan from Balancer to obtain the required funds.
- Swap tokens on Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2 to exploit price differences of at least 2% for each token pair.
- Ensure that all loans are repaid at the end of the transaction.
- Transfer any profits to the contract owner.

The contract should include functions to:
1. Execute the flash loan.
2. Perform the token swaps on Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2 for each token pair.
3. Repay the flash loan.
4. Transfer profits to the owner.

Here is a sample of the data for the trades:
- Token Pair: BTC/ETH
  - Uniswap v2 price: 1 BTC = 30 ETH
  - Sushiswap v2 price: 1 BTC = 29.5 ETH
- Token Pair: SOL/ETH
  - Uniswap v2 price: 1 SOL = 0.03 ETH
  - Sushiswap v2 price: 1 SOL = 0.029 ETH

The contract should be optimized for gas efficiency and security.
Integration with the App
To integrate this with your app, follow these steps:

Fetch Price Data: Periodically fetch price data for multiple token pairs from Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap v2.
Identify Arbitrage Opportunities: Check if the price difference between any token pairs exceeds the arbitrage threshold (e.g., 2%).
Generate Prompt: Use the generate_prompt function to create a prompt for the Groq API with the identified token pairs.
Call Groq API: Send the generated prompt to the Groq API to generate the Solidity smart contract.
Deploy Contract: Compile and deploy the generated contract using Web3.js or ethers.js.
Manage Contracts: Replace old contracts with new ones when better arbitrage opportunities are found.
